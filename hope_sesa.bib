abstract = {The behavior of migrating birds is governed by time-, energy- and danger-minimizing strategies. The adjustment of migration speed (i.e. the rate at which distance is covered during a migration) is a behavioral tactic that might contribute to these strategic goals. Shorter stopovers and greater fuel loads increase migration speed, but both require more intensive foraging at stopovers, making migrants more vulnerable to predators. A simple numerical model shows how seasonal alterations in migration speed can lower the exposure of western sandpipers to peregrine falcons, their most important predator. The ‘caution–speed–caution’ pattern of higher migration speed in the mid-passage period, observed in earlier work, requires that the intensive foraging necessary heightens vulnerability, and that migrants are exposed to both migrant predators as well as predators resident at migratory stopovers.},

@article{Moody1996,
abstract = {We examine the trade-off between gathering food and avoiding predation in the context of patch use by a group of animals. Often a forager will have to choose between feeding sites that differ in both energetic gain rate and predation risk. The ideal site will have a high gain rate and low risk of predation. However, intake rate will often decrease when the patch is shared with other foragers and it may be optimal for some individuals to feed elsewhere. Within the framework of ideal free theory, we investigate the distribution of foragers that will equalise individual fitness gains. We focus on a two- patch environment with continuous inputs of food. With reference to existing experimental studies, we examine the effects of risk dilution, food input rates and an animal's expectations of the future. We identify the effect of total animal numbers when one patch is subject to predation risk and the other is safe. Conditions under which the difference in intake rate in the two patches is constant are identified, as are conditions in which the ratio of animals in the two patches is constant, If current conditions do not alter future expectations an increase in input rates to the patches promotes increased use of the risky patch. Yet, if conditions are assumed to persist indefinitely the opposite effect is seen. When both patches are subject to predation risk, dilution of risk favours more extreme distributions, and may lead to more than one stable distribution. The results of these models are used to critically analyse previous work on the energetic equivalence of risk. This paper is intended to help guide the development of new experimental studies into the energy-risk trade-off.},

abstract = {1. Migrant bird populations are declining and have been linked to anthropogenic climate change. The phenology mismatch hypothesis predicts that migrant birds, which experience a greater rate of warming in their breeding grounds compared to their wintering grounds, are more likely to be in decline, because their migration will occur later and they may then miss the early stages of the breeding season. Population trends will also be negatively correlated with distance, because the chances of phenology mismatch increase with number of staging sites. 2. Population trends from the Palaearctic (1990-2000) and Nearctic (1980-2006) were collated for 193 spatially separate migrant bird populations, along with temperature trends for the wintering and breeding areas. An index of phenology mismatch was calculated as the difference between wintering and breeding temperature trends. 3. In the Nearctic, phenology mismatch was correlated with population declines as predicted, but in the Palaearctic, distance was more important. This suggests that differential global climate change may be responsible for contributing to some migrant species' declines, but its effects may be more important in the Nearctic. 4. Differences in geography and so average migration distance, migrant species composition and history of anthropogenic change in the two areas may account for the differences in the strength of the importance of phenology mismatch on migrant declines in the Nearctic and Palaearctic.},

@article{lank_effects_2003,
abstract = {We examine the potential selective importance of predation danger on the evolution of migration strategies of arctic-breeding calidrid sandpipers. Adult calidrids truncate parental care for reasons not obviously related to levels of food abundance on the breeding areas or at migratory stopover sites, suggesting that a different trade-off occurs between providing additional care and adult survivorship. The southward migrations of adult western sandpipers precede those of migratory peregrine falcons by almost a month. By moving early and quickly, adults remain ahead of migrant falcons all the way to their non-breeding areas, where they rapidly moult flight feathers. They complete the moult just as falcons arrive in late September-October. By migrating early, they avoid exposure to falcons when they are unusually vulnerable, due to the requirements for fuelling migratory flight and of wing feather moult. Juvenile western sandpipers migrate south just as falcon numbers start to increase, but do not moult flight feathers in their first winter. Pacific dunlin use an alternative strategy of remaining and moulting in Alaska after falcons depart, and migrating to their overwintering sites after migrants have passed. East of the Rocky Mountains, the southbound migration of falcons begins 4-6 weeks later. Southbound semipalmated sandpipers make extended migratory stopovers, but their lengths of stay shorten prior to falcon migration to the sites in September. Predation danger also may affect the evolution of migration routes. Southbound western sandpipers fly directly from Alaska to southern British Columbia, in contrast to the multi-stage journey northward along the Alaska panhandle. We estimate that a direct flight would be more economical on northward migration, but may be avoided because it would expose sandpipers to higher mass-dependent predation danger from migratory falcons, which travel north with sandpipers. By contrast, few raptors are present in Alaska during preparation for the southward flight. A temporal and spatial window of safety may also permit semipalmated sandpipers to become extremely vulnerable while preparing for trans-Atlantic southward flights. Danger management may account for the these previously enigmatic features of calidrid migration strategies, and aspects of those of other birds.},

@article{Fernandez2010c,
abstract = {Individuals manage their risk of predation in different ways in different situations. We studied the use of anti-predator behavior by Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri) at Bahia Santa Maria, northwestern Mexico, foraging in three habitats that differed in presumed predation danger. Brackish flats are completely open, making them theoretically less dangerous for feeding sandpipers than mangroves and cattail marshes, which have closer visual horizons. Western Sandpipers are sexually dimorphic, with females about 15{\%} longer-billed and 10{\%} heavier than males. We previously showed that male and female sandpipers differed in their habitat choice and relative body mass in ways consistent with differential responses to predation danger (Fernandez and Lank in Condor 108:547-557, 2006). Contrary to expectations, however, females were overrepresented in more dangerous habitats. Here, we examine differential usage across habitats and between the sexes of three anti-predator tactics-flock size, density within flocks, and vigilance rate-that may be used cumulatively to reinforce safety, or as trade-offs that compensate for levels of usage of each. We hypothesized, and found, that ordered differences occur among habitats, and that controlling for other factors, females were more cautious than males. For the most part, the use of these three tactics appeared to be cumulative, rather than compensatory. However, with respect to habitat use, birds appeared to compensate for the higher probability of mortality intrinsic to the use of higher-danger habitats by increasing the use of vigilance, foraging in tighter flocks, and maintaining lighter body weights (females only). Thus, both cumulative and compensatory processes operate among anti-predator tactics to determine the net level of safety and trade-off against other factors.},

abstract = {Abstract Cover can be either a source of protection or a source of danger for foragers. Distance to cover creates a gradient in predation risk that allows examining adjustments in anti-predator behaviour such as group size and vigilance. As distance to obstructive cover increases, both group size and vigilance are expected to decrease given that individuals have more time to react to a more distant source of danger. I provide an empirical test of these predictions in staging semipalmated sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) in a system controlling for many confounding factors that have marred earlier research. Controlling for food density, forager density and phenotypic attributes often correlated with distance to cover, I found that as distance to obstructive cover increased, sandpipers foraged in sparser groups, were less flighty and to some extent less vigilant. Such controlled studies are needed to re-assess the relationship between distance to cover and anti-predator behaviour.},

abstract = {In most birds, flight is the most important means of escape from predators. Impaired flight abilities due to increased wing loading may increase vulnerability to predation. To compensate for an increase in wing loading, birds are able to independently decrease body mass (BM) or increase pectoral muscle mass (PMM). Comparing nearshore and farshore foraging shorebird species, we develop a theory as to which of these responses should be the most appropriate. We hypothesize that nearshore foragers should respond to increased predation by increasing their PMM in order to promote speed-based escape. Instead, farshore foragers should decrease BM in order to improve agility for maneuvering escape. Experiments on 2 shorebird species are consistent with these predictions, but on the basis of the theoretical framework for evaluating effect size and biological significance developed here, more experiments are clearly needed.},

abstract = {Although age-related spatial segregation is ubiquitous, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we aim to elucidate the processes behind a previously established age-related foraging distribution of red knots (Calidris canutus canutus) in their main wintering area in West Africa (Banc d'Arguin, Mauritania). Based on 10 years of observations of 1232 uniquely color-ringed individuals of 1 to 18+ years old, we examined whether the observed age-related foraging distribution resulted from 1) spatial differences in mortality or 2) age-related shifts in habitat use. Using multistate capture-recapture modeling, we showed that with age foraging red knots moved away from the shoreline, that is, to areas with fewer surprise attacks by raptors. Considering uncertainties in the subjective gradient in predation danger with increasing distance from shore (as assessed from correlations between vigilance and distance from shore in foraging birds), we applied 2 different danger zone boundaries, at 40 m and 500 m from shore. Between years, red knots had a much higher chance to move from the dangerous nearshore area to the ``safe{\{}''{\}} area beyond (71-78{\%} and 26{\%} for 40-m and 500-m danger zone boundary, respectively), than vice versa (4{\%} and 14{\%}). For neither danger zone boundary value did we find differences in annual mortality for individuals using either dangerous or safe zone, so the move away from the shore with age is attributed to individual careers rather than differential mortality. We argue that longitudinal studies like ours will reveal that ontogenetic shifts in habitat use are more common than so far acknowledged.},

@article{Cresswell2013,
abstract = {Prey are often at risk from multiple predator species with differing hunting modes, but the resulting response to the spatial variation in predation risk (the landscape of fear) has rarely been considered in predator prey models. We tested whether attack frequency and hunting success along a habitat gradient (distance from an estuarine shoreline) differed between 2 predators hunting a single prey species, so affecting the optimal antipredation position along this gradient. Sparrowhawks ambushed redshanks most frequently from the predator-concealing cover of the shoreline, and their capture success rate was twice as high as when hunting far from the shoreline ({\textgreater} 50 m). In contrast, pursuit-hunting peregrines attacked redshanks most frequently far from the shoreline, though their capture success rate was unaffected by distance. Thus, the relative occurrence and success of both predators varied so that avoidance of one predator led to increased predation risk from the other, generating 2 broad conclusions. First, the equilibrium distribution of prey in the presence of multiple predators is likely to reflect the attack frequency and attack success rate of both predators combined across relevant environmental gradients. Second, predation-risk avoidance gradients may be less steep, or less tightly linked to any single habitat feature, than might be predicted if a single predator is considered.},

                   (Carassius carassius) provides an extreme example of

                   between body form and function in fishes. In crucian
                   carp, a deep body is induced by the presence of pike

  abstract =      {Large-scale changes in predator populations are
                   occurring worldwide due to (re-)introductions,
                   over-exploitation, or recovery after decimation by
                   pesticides and persecution. These widespread changes
                   may affect the distribution of their prey. We studied
                   the continental-scale distributions of non-breeding
                   Calidris alpina pacifica and C. a. hudsonia (Pacific
                   and Atlantic dunlins, respectively), as numbers of
                   their major predators---peregrines (Falco peregrinus)
                   and merlins (F. columbarius; together
                   `falcons')---increased after DDT was banned in 1973.
                   For the period 1975--2010 we compiled the number of
                   dunlins and falcons in each of 244 Christmas Bird
                   Count circles, which cover most of the dunlins'
                   non-breeding ranges. Over the study period, falcons
                   increased by 6.5- (Pacific) and 3.1- (Atlantic) fold,
                   spread to more count circles, and the number of
                   dunlins per falcon fell. The annual total count of
                   the two dunlin sub-species fluctuated strongly and
                   independently. We measured annual aggregation as the
                   expected proportion of a subspecies total found on
                   the same count circle as a randomly selected dunlin.
                   The average aggregation of Pacific dunlins (0.117)
                   was about double that of Atlantic dunlins (0.059),
                   with annual variation largely attributable to changes
                   in a few large count circles. The slope of the
                   aggregative response to year-on-year changes in
                   dunlin numbers was identical on the two coasts. The
                   response to the ongoing falcon increase was positive
                   and significant on the Pacific and slightly negative
                   on the Atlantic. We interpret these results using a
                   version of the ideal free distribution that includes
                   predation danger.},

                   Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus) resumed nesting
                   in Ontario in 1986. Between 1991 and 2006, at least
                   193 young fledged in southern Ontario and 548 young
                   fledged in northern Ontario. The number of breeding
                   pairs, nesting attempts, successful nests, and young
                   fledged all steadily increased in both regions
                   throughout this period. In southern Ontario, 25{\%}
                   of the breeding adults produced nearly 50{\%} of all
                   fledglings, and 87{\%} of the fledglings came from
                   just eight breeding sites. Direction of natal
                   dispersal was variable, but females consistently
                   moved farther than males, and there was frequent
                   movement both to and from adjacent American states.
                   The population recovery resulted from the release of
                   592 captive-bred F. p. anatum juveniles in Ontario

                   provinces and release efforts in adjacent regions of
                   the United States, where at least five subspecies

                   conservation success stories of recent times, but the
                   re-establishment of these apex predators in marine
                   systems has had consequences for seabirds. Sea eagles
                   affect seabirds both directly (by taking adults and
                   offspring and by inducing potentially costly
                   behaviors to minimize danger) and indirectly (by
                   facilitating the nest predators of seabirds, mainly
                   gulls and corvids). Repeated disturbance by hunting
                   eagles has caused seabirds to abandon colonies and
                   subcolonies in the tens to hundreds of thousands of
                   pairs. In recent years, sea eagles have been widely
                   implicated in local declines of surface-nesting
                   seabirds in the northeast Pacific Ocean, the
                   northwest Atlantic Ocean and northern Europe. The

                   eagle populations recover from decades of persecution
                   and chemical pollutants is discussed. We argue that
                   there is need for a research effort to investigate
                   the conservation implications of increasing sea
                   eagles in the context of multiple threats to seabird

                   migratory birds is crucial for conservation and
                   management of these species along their migratory
                   flyway. Recently, an increasing number of Barnacle
                   geese breeding in the Russian Arctic have delayed
                   their departure from their wintering site in The
                   Netherlands by approximately one month and have
                   reduced their staging duration at stopover sites in
                   the Baltic accordingly. Consequently, this extended
                   stay increases agricultural damage in The
                   Netherlands. Using a dynamic state variable approach
                   we explored three hypotheses about the underlying
                   causes of these changes in migratory behavior,
                   possibly related to changes in (i) onset of spring,
                   (ii) potential intake rates and (iii) predation
                   danger at wintering and stopover sites. Our
                   simulations showed that the observed advance in onset
                   of spring contradicts the observed delay of
                   departure, whereas both increased predation danger
                   and decreased intake rates in the Baltic can explain
                   the delay. Decreased intake rates are expected as a
                   result of increased competition for food in the
                   growing Barnacle goose population. However, the
                   effect of predation danger in the model was
                   particularly strong, and we hypothesize that Barnacle
                   geese avoid Baltic stopover sites as a response to
                   the rapidly increasing number of avian predators in
                   the area. Therefore, danger should be considered as
                   an important factor influencing Barnacle goose
                   migratory behavior, and receive more attention in
                   empirical studies.},

                   protection against starvation, but are a liability in
                   escape performance, and increase flight costs.
                   Peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) were scarce on
                   the Fraser River estuary in the 1970s, but their
                   numbers have since recovered, and they prey heavily
                   on dunlins. The increase has altered the balance
                   between predation and starvation risks for dunlins,
                   and thus how dunlins regulate roosting behavior and
                   body mass to manage the danger. We therefore
                   predicted an increase in the frequency of over-ocean
                   flocking as well as a decrease in the amount of fat
                   carried by dunlins over these decades.},

  abstract =      {A recent study demonstrated that semipalmated
                   sandpiper (Calidris pusilla) wing lengths have
                   shortened from the 1980s to the present-day. We
                   examined alternative and untested hypotheses for this
                   change at an important stopover site, James Bay,
                   Ontario, Canada. We evaluated morphometric patterns
                   in wing length and bill length by age and sex, when
                   possible, and assessed if wing shape has also changed
                   during this time-period. We investigated patterns of
                   morphological change in two additional Calidridine
                   sandpipers, white-rumped sandpipers (Calidris
                   fuscicollis) and least sandpipers (Calidris
                   minutilla), to determine if shorter wing lengths are
                   a widespread pattern in small sandpipers. We also
                   examined allometric changes in wing and bill lengths
                   to clarify if wing length declines were consistent
                   with historical scaling relationships and indicative
                   of a change in body size instead of only wing length
                   change. We found that including sex and wing shape in
                   analyses revealed important patterns in morphometric
                   change for semipalmated sandpipers. Wing lengths
                   declined for both sexes, but the magnitude of decline
                   was smaller and not significant for males.
                   Additionally, semipalmated sandpiper wings have
                   become more convex, a shape that increases
                   maneuverability in flight. Wing lengths, but not bill
                   lengths, declined for most species and age classes, a
                   pattern that was inconsistent with historical
                   allometric scaling relationships. For juvenile
                   semipalmated sandpipers, however, both bill and wing
                   lengths declined according to historical scaling
                   relationships, which could be a consequence of
                   nutritional stress during development or a shift in
                   the proportion of birds from smaller-sized, western
                   breeding populations. Except for juvenile
                   semipalmated sandpipers, we did not find evidence for
                   an increase in the proportion of birds from different
                   breeding populations at the stopover site. Given the
                   wide, hemispheric distribution of these sandpipers
                   throughout their annual cycles, our results, paired
                   with those from a previous study, provide evidence
                   for wide-spread reduction in wing lengths of
                   Calidridine sandpipers since the 1980s. The shorter
                   wing lengths and more convex wing shapes found in
                   this study support the hypothesis that selection has
                   favored more maneuverable wing morphology in small
                   sandpipers.},

                   ecosystems, causing habitat change and loss for
                   coastal species. Habitat loss is widely used as a
                   measurement of the risk of extinction, but because
                   many coastal species are migratory, the impact of
                   habitat loss will depend not only on its extent, but
                   also on where it occurs. Here, we develop a novel
                   graph-theoretic approach to measure the vulnerability
                   of a migratory network to the impact of habitat loss
                   from SLR based on population flow through the
                   network. We show that reductions in population flow
                   far exceed the proportion of habitat lost for 10
                   long-distance migrant shorebirds using the East
                   Asian–Australasian Flyway. We estimate that SLR
                   will inundate 23–40{\%} of intertidal habitat area
                   along their migration routes, but cause a reduction
                   in population flow of up to 72 per cent across the
                   taxa. This magnifying effect was particularly strong
                   for taxa whose migration routes contain
                   bottlenecks—sites through which a large fraction of
                   the population travels. We develop the bottleneck
                   index, a new network metric that positively
                   correlates with the predicted impacts of habitat loss
                   on overall population flow. Our results indicate that
                   migratory species are at greater risk than previously

                   structure on habitat use been a research focus in
                   wetland systems. During non-breeding periods when
                   food can be locally limited, wetland spatial pattern
                   across a landscape may be of great importance in
                   determining wetland use. We studied the influence of
                   landscape structure on abundances of wintering Dunlin
                   (Calidris alpina) and Killdeer (Charadrius vociferus)
                   observed on wetlands in the agricultural Willamette
                   Valley of Oregon, USA, during two winters (1999-2000,
                   2000-2001) of differing rainfall. We examined (1)
                   shorebird use within a sample of 100 km2 regions
                   differing in landscape structure (hectares of
                   shorebird habitat [wet, unvegetated]) and (2) use of
                   sites differing in landscape context (area of
                   shorebird habitat within a species-defined radius).
                   For use of sites, we also assessed the influence of
                   two local characteristics: percent of soil exposed
                   and area of wet habitat. We analyzed data using
                   linear regression and information-theoretic modeling.
                   During the dry winter (2000-2001), Dunlin were
                   attracted to regions with more wetland habitat and
                   their abundances at sites increased with greater area
                   of shorebird habitat within both the site and the
                   surrounding landscape. In contrast, Dunlin abundances
                   at sites were related to availability of habitat at
                   only a local scale during the wet winter (1999-2000).
                   Regional habitat availability was of little
                   importance in predicting Killdeer distributions, and
                   Killdeer site use appeared unrelated to habitat
                   distributions at both landscape and local scales.

                   that are located in areas with high wetland coverage},

  abstract =      {Human communities often discharge wastewaters into
                   estuaries, influencing their organic and pollutant
                   loading, benthic community and trophic structure. The
                   implementation of the Water Framework Directive has
                   encouraged the treatment of wastewater discharges
                   across European estuaries, but the implications for
                   invertebrate and waterbird communities are poorly
                   understood. We explore the effects of untreated
                   sewage discharges on the distribution and abundance
                   of foraging black-tailed godwits Limosa limosa and
                   their main benthic prey (bivalves and polychaetes) on
                   the Tejo estuary in Portugal, a major European
                   Special Protection Area with ongoing wastewater
                   improvements. Patches of mudflat in close proximity
                   to sewage streams (o30m) can support polychaete
                   densities and biomass that are an order of magnitude
                   higher than more distant sites (470 m), and godwits
                   foraging in these areas can attain the highest intake
                   rates recorded for the estuary. However, high intake
                   rates can also be attained on bivalve prey, and
                   bivalve biomass and density increase slightly with
                   distance from sewage streams. As the organic input
                   from sewage outfalls influences invertebrate
                   abundance and godwit foraging rates over relatively
                   small areas, the ongoing implementation of a sewage
                   treatment network on the Tejo estuary seems likely to
                   have only a limited impact on the wintering godwit
                   population. The localized effect of untreated sewage
                   discharges on benthic communities suggests that the
                   implications for predatory birds are relatively minor
                   where alternative prey are available, but may be more
                   severe in locations with more depauperate,
                   polychaete-dominated invertebrate communities.},

                   advanced in response to climate change, but the
                   effects differ between sites. Here, we examine the
                   geographical variation in laying- date trends in a
                   short-distance migrant, the European starling Sturnus
                   vulgaris, and a long-distance migrant, the pied
                   flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca. We model the trend in
                   laying date for these 2 spe- cies—between 1980 and
                   2004 for most of their European breeding areas—by
                   combining geographi- cal variation in mean laying
                   date, the effect of temperature on laying date, and
                   spatial variation in tem- perature change. Starlings
                   are predicted to have advanced breeding over most of
                   their range, with the greatest advance in
                   north-eastern Europe. In contrast, pied flycatchers
                   have delayed their laying in northern Europe, but
                   have advanced their laying in western and central
                   Europe. The species differ because pied flycatchers
                   lay their eggs 25 d later at each site than
                   starlings, and temperatures during these 2 periods
                   show different trends. Temperatures during migration
                   have also changed differently for populations heading
                   to different breeding areas. This was most pronounced
                   for pied flycatchers; northern populations experience
                   an increase in temperatures during migration, while
                   more southern populations presently still migrate at
                   temperatures similar to those experienced 25 yr ago.
                   As a conse- quence the southern population may be
                   constrained in adapting to climate change by low
                   tempera- tures during migration. There is a large
                   contrast in how circumstances during migration and at
                   the breeding grounds have changed: populations that
                   advanced breeding most were subjected to the low- est
                   temperature increases during migration. The temporal
                   and spatial variation in temperature change has
                   important consequences on how migrants adapt to
                   ongoing climate change.},

                   Bay of Fundy and experiences the largest tidal range
                   in the world. Radiotelemetry was used to monitor
                   duration of stay of 30 adult and seven juvenile
                   Semipalmated Sandpipers. Adults arriving in Cobequid
                   Bay early in the migration period experienced a
                   greater number of extreme high tides ({\textgreater}
                   15 m) that submerged preferred roost sites, and
                   stayed on average 8.1 days longer than those that
                   arrived later. Juvenile duration of stay was not
                   significantly different from adults. When tides
                   exceeded 15 m, Semipalmated Sandpipers engaged in
                   over ocean flocking at high tide; however, this
                   behavior was not observed when high tides were 13.6 m
                   or less. These extra flights led to higher energy
                   expenditure by early migrants, requiring an estimated
                   3.8 to 4.3-day increase in length of stay to reach
                   the same mass as later migrants. In the future,
                   predicted sea level rise could increase the frequency
                   of extreme tidal amplitudes and result in greater

  abstract =      {Birds migrating between widely separated wintering
                   and breeding grounds may choose among a number of
                   potential stopover sites by using different
                   itineraries. Our aim is to predict the optimal
                   migration schedule in terms of (1) rates of fuel
                   deposition, (2) departure fuel loads and (3) stopover
                   site use, when only a handful of such sites are
                   available. We assume that reproductive success
                   depends on the date and fuel load at arrival on the
                   breeding grounds. On migration, the birds face a
                   trade-off between gaining fuel and avoiding
                   predation. To allow the optimal decision at any given
                   moment to depend on the fuel load and the location of
                   the bird, as well as on unpredictability in
                   conditions, we employed stochastic dynamic
                   programming. This technique assumes that the birds
                   know the probability distribution of conditions in
                   all sites, but not the particular realization they
                   will encounter. We examined the consequences of
                   varying aspects of the model, like (1) the shape of
                   the relationship between arrival date and fitness,
                   (2) the presence of stochasticity in fuel deposition
                   rates and wind conditions, and (3) the nature of
                   predation (i.e. whether predation risk depends on the
                   fuel load of the birds or their feeding intensity).
                   Optimal fuel deposition rates are predicted to be
                   constant if there are either only predation risks of
                   maintaining stores or only risks of acquiring fuel
                   stores. If only fuel acquisition is risky, fuel
                   deposition rates can be below maximum, especially if
                   there also is an intermediate best arrival time at
                   the breeding ground. The fuel deposition rate at a
                   site then depends not just on the site's quality but
                   on the qualities of all visited sites. In contrast,
                   rates of fuel deposition are not constant if both the
                   acquisition and the maintenance of fuel stores carry
                   risk. Optimal departure fuel loads are just enough to
                   reach the next site if the environment is
                   deterministic and are simply set by the energetic
                   cost of covering the distance. As with
                   time-minimizing models, more fuel than necessary to
                   reach a site is only deposited under very restricted
                   circumstances. Such overloads are more likely to be
                   deposited if either fuel gains or expenditure are
                   stochastic. The size of overloads is then determined
                   by the variance in fuel gain at the target site and
                   the worst possible conditions during flight. Site use
                   is modified by differences in predation risk between
                   sites and differences in fuel deposition rates. An
                   expression derived to predict site use under time
                   minimization provides a good approximation in
                   state-dependent models. In some cases, the
                   possibility of starvation may influence optimal
                   decisions, even when the probability of starvation
                   under the optimal policy is low. This effect of
                   starvation has also been found in other contexts.},

                   different migration policies, the optimum departure
                   fuel load for migratory birds can be calculated. We
                   evaluate the optimum departure fuel loads associated
                   with minimization of three different currencies: (1)
                   overall time of migration, (2) energy cost of
                   transport and (3) total energy cost of migration.
                   Predicted departure loads are highest for (1), lowest
                   for (2) and intermediate for (3). Further, currencies
                   (1) and (3) show departure loads dependent on the
                   fuel accumulation rate at stopovers, while (2) is not
                   affected by variation in the rate of fuel
                   accumulation. Furthermore, fuel loads optimized with
                   respect to currency (3) will differ depending on the
                   size (body mass) of the bird and the energy density
                   of the fuel. We review ecological situations in which
                   the various currencies may apply, and suggest how a
                   combination of stopover decisions and observations of
                   flight speed may be used to decide among the three
                   cases of migration policies. Finally, we calculate
                   that the total energy cost of migration is roughly
                   divided between flight and stopover as 1:2. The total
                   time of migration is similarly divided between flight
                   and stopover as 1:7, probably with a relatively
                   longer stopover time in larger species. Hence, we may
                   expect strong selection pressures to optimize the
                   fuel accumulation strategies during stopover
                   episodes. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.},

  year =          {2005},
  abstract =      {During travel, migrants may encounter unfamiliar
                   habitats and predators and visit sites for which they
                   lack information on predation risk. Temporary stops
                   during migration permit only limited opportunities to
                   gather information about risk, and other priorities,
                   such as the need to forage, may restrict these
                   opportunities. Under these conditions, the extent to
                   which migrants respond to variations in predation
                   risk is unclear. We studied small passerine birds
                   during migratory stopover to determine whether their
                   behaviour was related to variation in risk of capture
                   by migrating birds of prey. We used two approaches,
                   observational and experimental. Observations revealed
                   that blue-grey gnatcatchers, Polioptila caerulea, and
                   American redstarts, Setophaga ruticilla, moved deeper
                   into oak shrubs as the number of sharp-shinned hawks,
                   Accipiter striatus, at the site increased.
                   Furthermore, blue-grey gnatcatchers moved at slower
                   rates as counts of hawks increased. The experiment
                   revealed that blue-grey gnatcatchers had lower rates
                   of both movement and foraging after exposure to a
                   gliding model hawk. These results provide evidence
                   that predator avoidance remains a priority during
                   migration and that migrants are able to assess risk
                   to some extent during temporary stopover. In
                   addition, the results suggest that predator avoidance
                   behaviour may limit foraging opportunities during
                   stopover by restricting habitat use. (c) 2005 The

  abstract =      {The upper Bay of Fundy is a critical stopover site
                   for Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) during
                   their fall migration. However, little is known about
                   factors that influence selection of feeding and
                   roosting sites by these birds, or the extent to which
                   birds move between different sites during their time
                   in the region. Using radio-telemetry, we studied
                   movement patterns, examined habitat use, and tested
                   hypotheses associated with factors influencing
                   foraging and roost-site selection. Movements of
                   radio-tagged sandpipers were tracked in the upper Bay
                   of Fundy in August 2004 and 2005. In 2004, sandpipers
                   from the Minas Basin, Nova Scotia and Chignecto Bay,
                   New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, were tracked, and in
                   2005, sandpipers were tracked only in Chignecto Bay.
                   Sandpipers were highly mobile in both the Minas Basin
                   2004 and Chignecto Bay 2005, making daily movements
                   of up to 20 km between foraging and roosting sites,
                   although very little movement was detected in
                   Chignecto Bay in 2004. Migrating sandpipers appeared
                   to select foraging sites based on relative safety, as
                   measured by distance to cover, provided that these
                   sites offered an adequate food supply. Similarly,
                   roosting sandpipers preferred sites that were far
                   from nearby trees that might offer cover to
                   predators. This preference for safe sites became more
                   apparent later in their stay in the Bay of Fundy,
                   when birds were heavier and, therefore, possibly more
                   vulnerable to predation. Semipalmated Sandpipers
                   appear to be flexible during their time in the upper
                   Bay of Fundy, displaying year-to-year and
                   site-to-site variability in movement and mudflat
                   usage. Therefore, multiple, synchronized population
                   counts should be conducted at known roost sites in
                   order to more accurately estimate Semipalmated
                   Sandpiper abundance in this region. Furthermore, in a
                   highly dynamic system where food can be variable,
                   landscape features such as distance to cover may be
                   important factors to consider when selecting
                   candidate sites for shorebird conservation measures.},

                   the amount of fuel and duration of stopover have not
                   been considered. We analyzed seasonal patterns of

                   peregrine falcons Falco peregrinus. We predicted that
                   individuals on stopover far in advance of the
                   seasonal arrival of falcons would adjust stopover
                   length and hence relative fuel load to migrate slowly
                   and cautiously. We predicted that individuals on
                   stopover later in the season would increase migratory
                   speed as the arrival of migratory falcons came
                   closer, while individuals on stopover under or behind
                   the passage of falcons would migrate slowly. Adult
                   and juvenile semipalmated and adult western
                   sandpipers migrated prior to seasonal increases in
                   peregrine abundance, and as predicted, the seasonal
                   patterns of their stopover durations are consistent
                   with an increase in the speed of migration as the
                   date of peregrine arrival approached. Juvenile
                   western sandpipers, in contrast, migrating
                   concurrently with falcons, slowed their speed of
                   migration as predator abundance increased. Stopover
                   patterns differ between species due to different
                   relative fuel loads. The results fit predictions made

                   time-limited during the pre-breeding season compared
                   to the post-breeding season. Although
                   breeding-related time constraints may be absent
                   post-breeding, additional factors such as predation
                   risk could lead to time constraints that were
                   previously underestimated. By using an automated
                   radio telemetry system, we compared pre- and
                   post-breeding movements of long-distance migrant
                   shorebirds on a continent-wide scale. From 2014 to
                   2016, we deployed radio transmitters on 1,937
                   individuals of 4 shorebird species at 13 sites
                   distributed across North America. Following
                   theoretical predictions, all species migrated faster
                   during the pre-breeding season, compared to the
                   post-breeding season. These differences in migration
                   speed between seasons were attributable primarily to
                   longer stopover durations in the post-breeding
                   season. In contrast, and counter to our expectations,
                   all species had higher airspeeds during the
                   post-breeding season, even after accounting for
                   seasonal differences in wind. Arriving at the
                   breeding grounds in good body condition is beneficial
                   for survival and reproductive success and this
                   energetic constraint might explain why airspeeds are
                   not maximised in the pre-breeding season. We show
                   that the higher airspeeds in the post-breeding season
                   precede a wave of avian predators, which could
                   suggest that migrant shorebirds show
                   predation-minimizing behaviour during the
                   post-breeding season. Our results reaffirm the
                   important role of time constraints during northward
                   migration and suggest that both energy and
                   predation-risk constrain migratory behaviour during
                   the post-breeding season.},

                   of western sandpipers (Calidris mauri) at migratory

                   migratory body mass and stopover durations of western
                   sandpipers have fallen steadily at some stopovers in

                   between years, sites and seasons strongly implicate
                   increasing danger from the recovery of peregrine
                   falcons (Falco peregrinus) as a causal factor. A
                   decade-long ongoing steep decline in sandpiper
                   numbers censused on our study site is explained
                   entirely by the shortening stopover duration, rather
                   than fewer individuals using the site. Such
                   behavioural changes are probably general among
                   migratory shorebird species, and may be contributing
                   to the widespread census declines reported in North

                   deposits are assumed to improve the capability for
                   long-distance migration by birds but may also
                   heighten their vulnerability or exposure to
                   predators. Studies of habitat use by migrants have
                   emphasized the importance of feeding, and relatively
                   few studies have considered how migrants manage the
                   dangers inherent in acquiring and storing fuel.
                   Migrant western sandpipers (Calidris mauri) stop over
                   on coastal mudflats characterized by a strong
                   feeding-danger gradient, with both food and danger
                   decreasing with distance from the shoreline. We
                   experimentally manipulated danger by adding
                   obstructive cover and measured sandpiper usage along
                   this gradient. We compared sandpiper usage along a
                   transect extending 100 m on either side of the
                   obstruction with that on matched control transects
                   without obstructions. The dropping density
                   accumulated during a low-tide period provided a
                   sensitive measure of sandpiper usage. Mean usage on
                   control transects was 2.3 droppings/m(2) and was
                   lower by 1.5 droppings/m(2) (65{\%}) on treatment
                   transects. Usage did not differ between control and
                   treatment transects at the furthest distances from
                   the obstruction, the difference increased with
                   proximity to the obstruction, and was greater by on
                   average 0.9 droppings/m(2) on the oceanward side (low
                   food abundance) than on the shoreward side (high food
                   abundance). All these findings were predicted by
                   danger management theory. Our study provides
                   experimental evidence that migrant birds are
                   sensitive to danger on stopover and has implications
                   for understanding migration strategies.},

                   Falcons (Falco peregrinus) captured 94 Dunlins
                   (Calidris alpina) in 652 hunts. The two main hunting
                   methods were open attacks on flying Dunlins (62{\%})
                   and stealth attacks on roosting or foraging Dunlins
                   (35{\%}). Peregrines hunted throughout the day, yet
                   the kill rate per observation hour dropped 1-2 hr
                   before high tide and peaked 1-2 hr after high tide.
                   The drop in kill rate coincided with the departure of
                   the mass of Dunlins for over-ocean flights lasting
                   2-4 hr. The peak in kill rate occurred just after the
                   tide began to ebb and the Dunlins returned to forage
                   in the shore zone. The hypothesis that closeness to
                   shoreline vegetation is dangerous for Dunlins is
                   supported by three converging lines of evidence: (1)
                   the high success rate (44{\%}) of peregrine hunts
                   over the shore zone compared to the rate (11{\%})
                   over tide flats and ocean; (2) the high kill rate per
                   observation hour at high tide; and (3) the positive
                   correlation of kill rate with the height of the
                   tides. Seven of 13 Dunlins killed by Merlins (Falco
                   columbarius) and all five Dunlins killed by Northern
                   Harriers (Circus cyaneus) were also captured in the
                   shore zone.},

                   wintering grounds in South America. While in the
                   area, they feed extensively on mudflat invertebrates.
                   Historically the amphipod Corophium volutator
                   (Pallas, 1766) has been thought to make up the
                   majority of their diet. However, we have recently
                   observed flexibility in foraging behaviour and prey
                   selection by sandpipers. The extent of this
                   flexibility and the current diet composition is
                   unknown. To address these knowledge gaps, we assessed
                   Semipalmated Sandpiper diets using stable isotope
                   analyses of blood plasma and available prey items.
                   Data were collected in two arms of the Bay of Fundy
                   during summer 2009 and 2010. Diets fluctuated between
                   years and sites, but in all cases the diet was much
                   more diverse than previously thought. Polychaetes and
                   biofilm made substantial contributions, and C.
                   volutator was still present in the diet, but at much
                   reduced levels than previously noted. This previously
                   unrecognized inclusion of biofilm in the diet is
                   consistent with recent observations of other calidrid
                   shorebirds. Based on measures of prey availability,
                   there is little evidence of preference for C.

                   New Brunswick, Canada, during August of 2009 and
                   2010. Peregrine Falcons ( Falco peregrinus ) were
                   locally reintroduced and increased from one active
                   nest site in 1989 to 27 in 2010, which coincided with
                   a decline of sandpipers roosting at Mary's Point from
                   an annual mean of 161,000 in 1976-1982 to 15,000 or
                   less during this study. Mean roosting time of flocks
                   was 33 min (range = 10 to 40 min; N = 6). Sandpipers
                   returned to the beach 1 h:36 min after high-tide

                   flushed again by falcons. On ten of 19 days, during
                   part of the high-tide period, flocks of sandpipers
                   remained in flight over the ocean. Termed Over-Ocean
                   Flocking (OOF), this behavior was seen on days when
                   spring tides inundated all beach habitat, and also at
                   lower tides, which supports the hypothesis that OOF
                   is an antipredator strategy intended to avoid
                   surprise attacks by falcons near the shore. Raptors

                   International and Ontario Shorebird Surveys, as well
                   as the Quebec Checklist, collected between 1974-1998,
                   consistently showed negative trends. An additional
                   eleven years of data was assessed to determine if
                   declines were ongoing. Analysis (Pearson correlation)
                   of the Quebec Checklist data indicated a significant
                   decline overall, from 1976 to 2008, and the
                   percentage of checklists reporting flocks of
                   {\textgreater}1,000 birds has decreased significantly
                   since the 1970s. New analyses of population trends
                   with migration monitoring data from eastern and
                   central North America were conducted for the 35-year
                   period from 1974 to 2009, using program ESTEQNINDEXE.
                   Trends, although generally negative, were not
                   statistically significant. In the North Atlantic
                   region, where survey sites had the highest counts of
                   Semipalmated Sandpipers, average abundance indices
                   showed a pronounced decrease between 1985 and 1999
                   and an increase since then. Although the trend was
                   not statistically significant, declines in Ontario
                   amounted to an estimated 8{\%} per year from 1974 to
                   2009. Counts were variable for Semipalmated
                   Sandpipers in the Midcontinent region, although
                   average abundance indices appeared lower in the
                   second half of the analysis period (1989-2009). Thus,
                   the population status of Semipalmated Sandpipers in

  abstract =      {Foragers use a variety of anti-predator behaviours to
                   increase their safety from predators. While foraging,
                   animals should alter usage within or between sites to
                   balance the benefits of feeding with the costs of
                   predation. I tested how the distribution of food
                   abundance and predation danger interacts to explain
                   spatial usage (i.e. distance from shore) by migratory
                   western sandpipers (Calidris mauri) at Boundary Bay,
                   British Columbia, Canada, during northward and
                   southward migrations. At Boundary Bay there are
                   opposing spatial gradients in the distribution of
                   food abundance and safety from predators. Predation
                   danger for sandpipers is high near the shoreline
                   where there is approach cover for falcons and
                   decreases with distance from shore. Food abundance
                   for sandpipers declines as distance from the
                   shoreline increases. Food and danger attributes at
                   Boundary Bay also differ temporally, such that food
                   abundance is higher during southward migration, and
                   predation danger is higher during northward
                   migration. The spatial usage by western sandpipers
                   balances the tradeoff between the opposing spatial
                   gradients in food and safety. For both migratory
                   periods spatial usage of the mudflat by sandpipers is
                   highest at distances from the shoreline where food
                   abundance and predation danger are intermediate.
                   During the northward migration sandpiper usage is
                   highest between 150 and 500 m from the shoreline, and
                   during the southward migration sandpiper usage is
                   highest between 100 and 600 m from the shoreline.
                   Despite temporal differences in food and danger
                   attributes, spatial usage of the site by sandpipers
                   does not differ between migratory periods.
                   Understanding how the distribution of food abundance
                   and predation danger interact to affect the within
                   site usage by shorebirds has important implications
                   for assessments of site quality.},

                   coastline have caused extensive loss, degradation and
                   fragmentation of coastal ecosystems, threatening the
                   delivery of important ecosystem services1. As a
                   result, alarming losses of mangrove, coral reef,
                   seagrass, kelp forest and coastal marsh ecosystems
                   have occurred1–6. However, owing to the difficulty
                   of mapping intertidal areas globally, the
                   distribution and status of tidal flats—one of the
                   most extensive coastal ecosystems—remain unknown7.
                   Here we present an analysis of over 700,000 satellite
                   images that maps the global extent of and change in
                   tidal flats over the course of 33 years
                   (1984–2016). We find that tidal flats, defined as
                   sand, rock or mud flats that undergo regular tidal
                   inundation7, occupy at least 127,921 km2
                   (124,286–131,821 km2, 95{\%} confidence interval).
                   About 70{\%} of the global extent of tidal flats is
                   found in three continents (Asia (44{\%} of total),
                   North America (15.5{\%} of total) and South America
                   (11{\%} of total)), with 49.2{\%} being concentrated
                   in just eight countries (Indonesia, China, Australia,
                   the United States, Canada, India, Brazil and
                   Myanmar). For regions with sufficient data to develop
                   a consistent multi-decadal time series—which
                   included East Asia, the Middle East and North
                   America—we estimate that 16.02{\%}
                   (15.62–16.47{\%}, 95{\%} confidence interval) of
                   tidal flats were lost between 1984 and 2016.
                   Extensive degradation from coastal development1,
                   reduced sediment delivery from major rivers8,9,
                   sinking of riverine deltas8,10, increased coastal
                   erosion and sea-level rise11 signal a continuing
                   negative trajectory for tidal flat ecosystems around
                   the world. Our high-spatial-resolution dataset
                   delivers global maps of tidal flats, which
                   substantially advances our understanding of the
                   distribution, trajectory and status of these poorly
                   known coastal ecosystems.},

  abstract =      {Measures of animal behavior can be used in a variety
                   of situations to make inferences about the
                   environment and population status. Work by our
                   research group shows that migratory shorebirds adjust
                   their usage of, and behavior at, stopover sites in
                   response to environmental conditions. Motivated by
                   this, we built an individual-based model of migrating
                   shorebirds moving through a sequence of alternating
                   small and large stopover sites. Birds at larger sites
                   are safer from predators, but we assumed that less
                   food is available than at small sites. In the model,
                   both predation risk and food intake are
                   density-dependent, and the behavior of migrants is
                   controlled by two rules: one that determines whether
                   a bird will depart a stopover site, and one that
                   controls the individual's foraging versus vigilance
                   intensity. The optimal behavior is calculated by
                   maximizing a payoff function that depends on arrival
                   date and arrival energy stores at the final site. We
                   used this model to predict mass gain, foraging
                   intensity, and usage by migrants of small and large
                   sites under various conditions. We examined the
                   effects of a flyway-wide reduction in the amount of
                   food, a flyway-wide increase in predation danger, and
                   the effects of lowering the overall population size.
                   The mass action of many individuals, each optimizing
                   its migration timing and routing, leads to the
                   emergence of distinctive patterns of behavior and
                   site choice under these differing environmental
                   conditions. When food availability is reduced
                   throughout the flyway, Our model predicts that
                   foraging intensity increases at every stopover site,
                   thereby forcing birds to accept greater danger to
                   maintain the fitness benefit of a timely arrival to
                   the breeding area. A flyway-wide increase in
                   predation danger results in fewer migrants choosing
                   (and/or migrants staying a shorter time at) small
                   stopover sites, balanced by a higher usage of large
                   sites. These effects contrast with what is observed
                   under true population declines, when the usage of
                   both small and large sites declines.},

  abstract =      {A reduction in individual vigilance with an increase
                   in group size is one of the most frequently reported
                   relationships in the study of animal behaviour. It
                   has been argued that this phenomenon may not be a
                   direct consequence of an increase in group size but
                   may be due to other factors relating to increased
                   group size, such as increased foraging competition.
                   However, there is evidence for a direct relationship
                   between group size and vigilance where other
                   variables have been controlled. The aim of this
                   review is to highlight the fact that the functional
                   explanation of the group size effect remains unclear.
                   Some authors have considered just one hypothesis, the
                   group vigilance or ‘many eyes' hypothesis. This
                   states that, by taking advantage of the vigilance of
                   other group members, individuals can reduce their own
                   vigilance. However, there is an alternative, or
                   additional, possibility that if individual vigilance
                   declines with a reduction in individual predation
                   risk, the group size effect could be accounted for by
                   a reduction in individual risk at higher group sizes,
                   as is widely thought to occur through encounter,
                   dilution and confusion effects. In this review, it is
                   shown that evidence previously interpreted in terms
                   of one hypothesis may also be interpreted in terms of
                   the other. Future research should be directed towards
                   explicit consideration of the two effects and
                   empirical tests to distinguish their relative
                   importance. It is proposed that the individual risk
                   hypothesis, with group vigilance as one element,
                   provides a more general framework for understanding
                   variation in vigilance behaviour with group size and
                   with other factors.},

                   generally been explained in terms of distinct
                   predator detection and risk-dilution effects. We show
                   that a strict distinction between detection and
                   dilution disappears when information about attacks is
                   imperfectly shared (as it is in reality).
                   Furthermore, dilution and detection effects change
                   depending on when during an attack the predator
                   targets a particular prey individual for pursuit.
                   Realistic detection and dilution effects probably
                   interact with each other and also with the targeting
                   behaviour of predators. Instead of considering
                   detection and dilution effects on vigilance, it may
                   be more profitable to consider each prey's
                   probability of being targeted during an attack and
                   its probability of escaping if attacked. This
                   perspective emphasizes that a full understanding of
                   safety in numbers requires an understanding of

                   increase in group size that releases more time for

                   of companions is the same irrespective of
                   nearest-neighbour distance. However, social
                   information transmission has been found to be
                   affected by neighbour distance. Our goal was to
                   assess the role of both group size and neighbour
                   distance in explaining foraging and scanning
                   behaviour in flocks of brown-headed cowbirds,
                   Molothrus ater. We conducted a seminatural experiment
                   in which we simultaneously manipulated group size (3,
                   5, 7 individuals) and minimum neighbour distance (0,
                   2.5, 5 m) of birds in visual but not physical
                   contact. Foraging and vigilance were affected by both
                   flock size and neighbour distance in different ways.
                   Flock size generally influenced foraging and scanning
                   behaviour, with an initial increase/decrease and then
                   a levelling off at higher flock sizes. Neighbour
                   distance also affected individual behaviour in a
                   nonlinear fashion, but we also found patterns for
                   pecking rate and proportion of time scanning that
                   suggest linear changes. We found that the strength of
                   the group-size effect varied with neighbour distance
                   and was weakest when the birds were furthest away
                   from each other. Future studies should consider as
                   members of a group only those individuals within a
                   radius that allows detection and dilution effects to
                   operate. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of

                   a predator in social groups. However, how does it
                   work in species that do not produce such signals? We
                   investigated how detection of a threat occurred in
                   groups of kangaroos. We showed that detectors,
                   through their vigilant posture, provided information
                   about the threat to other close group members and
                   reactions proceeded sequentially like a domino
                   effect. Collective detection thus appears not to be
                   restricted to social species that exhibit conspicuous
                   alarm signals.Although collective detection plays a
                   key role in determining individual survival, few
                   studies have carefully examined the collective
                   process of detection. We investigated collective
                   detection in the eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus
                   giganteus), a species that forages in temporary
                   groups and rarely produces auditory alarm signals on
                   detection. In experimental trials, we exposed one
                   group member to a predation threat (a python, Morelia
                   spilota) that its companions could only detect
                   indirectly by observing the reaction of the detector.
                   We videotaped these and control trials in which
                   individuals were not exposed to the python and focal
                   females simply used vigilance routinely. Our aims
                   were to 1) examine whether collective detection
                   occurred and, if so, 2) investigate the temporal
                   pattern of the information transfer among
                   individuals. The latencies between the focal females
                   first scans and those of their 4 neighbors were
                   shorter in the exposed than those in the control
                   groups. The latencies between successive individuals
                   scans were on average shorter in the exposed groups
                   and at the beginning of the reaction chain, and
                   interindividual distances acted to constrain
                   information transfer. More individuals became
                   vigilant in the exposed than in the control groups.
                   Thus, detection of the snake by focal females
                   provided information about a potential threat to
                   other close group members and reactions to this
                   initial detection proceeded sequentially like a
                   domino effect. Collective detection thus is not
                   restricted to social species that exhibit conspicuous
                   alarm signals.},

                   interference competition have often been applied to
                   foraging waders and less so to other foragers, even
                   though these models are, in principle, generally
                   applicable. At present, however, it is still unclear
                   whether interference competition is of importance for
                   foraging waders. To support this idea experimental
                   evidence and knowledge of the mechanisms underlying
                   interference effects are required. We experimentally
                   determined the relationship between forager density
                   and foraging success in two wader species: the red
                   knot (Calidris canutus) and the ruddy turnstone
                   (Arenaria interpres). With each of the two species,
                   we conducted an experiment consisting of 300 one-min
                   trials. In these trials we scored the behavior and
                   the foraging success of focal individuals at specific
                   combinations of bird and prey density. Irrespective
                   of prey density, individuals of both species
                   discovered fewer prey items at higher bird densities.
                   Despite this, only in turnstones did intake rates
                   decline with increasing bird density. Knots
                   compensated for a lower prey-discovery rate by
                   rejecting fewer prey items at higher bird densities.
                   In knots, bird density had a complex, nonmonotonic
                   effect on the time spent vigilant and searching. In
                   turnstones the main effect of increased bird density
                   was a reduction in the prey-encounter rate, that is,
                   the reward per unit search time. Effects on the time
                   spent vigilant and the time spent searching were less
                   pronounced than in knots. Thus, the mechanistic basis
                   of the effects of bird density was complex for each
                   of the two species and differed between them.},

                   the population dynamics of competitors is usually
                   assumed to operate directly through starvation, yet
                   may also affect survival indirectly through
                   behaviourally mediated effects that affect risk of
                   predation. Thus, competition can affect more than two
                   trophic levels, and we aim here to provide an example
                   of this. We show that the foraging success of
                   redshanks Tringa totanus (L.) foraging on active prey
                   was highest in the front of flocks, whereas this was
                   not the case for redshanks foraging on inactive prey.
                   Also, when foraging on active prey, foraging success
                   in a flock decreased as more birds passed through a
                   patch, while overall foraging success was not lower
                   on subsequent visits to the same patch. Thus,
                   redshanks foraging on active prey suffered from
                   interference competition, whereas this was not the
                   case for redshanks foraging on inactive prey. This
                   interference competition led to differences in
                   activity: redshanks attaining a lower foraging
                   success had a higher walking rate. Greater activity
                   was associated with wider flock spacing and shorter
                   distances to cover, which has previously been shown
                   to increase predation risk and mortality from
                   sparrowhawks Accipiter nisus (L.). We conclude that
                   behavioural adaptations of prey species can lead to
                   interference competition in foraging redshanks, and
                   thus can affect their predation risk and mortality
                   through increased activity. This study is one of the
                   first to show how interference competition can be a
                   mechanism for behaviourally mediated indirect
                   effects, and provides further evidence for the
                   suggestion that a single species occupying an
                   intermediate trophic level may be simultaneously
                   top-down controlled by a predator and bottom-up
                   controlled by a behavioural response of its prey.},

                   many species of birds and mammals, but the effect of
                   group size can be confounded by several ecological
                   factors, most notably food density. Given that large
                   groups often aggregate in areas of higher food
                   density and that vigilance may be reduced when
                   animals feed more, the group-size effect of vigilance
                   may be confounded by the direct effect of food
                   density on vigilance. In this paper, I examine the
                   theoretical expectations regarding the effect of food
                   density on vigilance and review the available
                   empirical evidence. Two bodies of theory predict
                   either no relationship or a negative relationship
                   between vigilance and food density, but none has been
                   tested explicitly. The empirical support for a
                   negative relationship is mixed given that many
                   studies actually document a positive correlation
                   between vigilance and food density. I review the
                   factors modulating the effect of food density on
                   vigilance and show that there are several reasons to
                   believe that the case against a confounding effect of
                   food density is not as strong as expected. In fact,
                   food density can actually mask the expected decrease
                   in vigilance with group size. A statement about the
                   magnitude of the group-size effect on vigilance will
                   require an assessment of the role of food density as
                   well as the many factors reviewed here that modulate

                   elusive. Migrants must make behavioral decisions that
                   can favor either migra- tory speed or safety from
                   predators, but often not both. We compare the
                   behavior of adult and juvenile western sandpipers
                   Calidris mauri during the course of their temporally
                   segregat- ed passages at a major stopover site. Here,
                   the passage and winter arrival of an important
                   predator, the peregrine falcon Falco peregrinus
                   begins near the end of the adult sandpiper passage
                   (July) and increases rapidly through the juvenile
                   passage (August). The mortality-minimizing hypothesis
                   pre- dicts that as the falcon front is distant but
                   approaching, sand- pipers should initially increase
                   the fuel-loading rate (lowered vigilance and predator
                   apprehension) to increase migration speed and so
                   maintain their head start. As the falcon front gains
                   proximity to and passes over the stopover site, sand-
                   pipers should become increasingly cautious. Our
                   measure- ments show that adults decreased vigilance
                   during the period prior to falcon arrival, and had
                   lower vigilance overall than juveniles. Juveniles
                   were more apprehensive, flying further and longer in
                   response to disturbance by a falcon silhouette. This
                   trend was reversed in response to a human approach.
                   Both groups were more vigilant and more apprehensive
                   in a study year with earlier falcon arrival. These
                   results suggest that late (juvenile) and early
                   (adult) migrants minimize mor- tality on migration in
                   different ways, adults by increased migratory speed

                   (samples), 100s of metres (transects) and many
                   kilometres (mudflats). Population density exhibited
                   low variation between years ({\textless} 10{\%} of
                   the random variation), but showed high variation at
                   our smallest and largest spatial scales (45{\%}
                   between samples. 2{\%} between transects, and 40{\%}
                   between mudflats), i.e., the distribution of C.
                   volutator within a mudflat was aggregated at the
                   scale of metres, but not at that of 100s of metres.
                   Thus, relatively few transects. but many samples per
                   transect, are required for good representation of
                   density on a mudflat. Fecundity was similar between
                   mudflats, but proportion juvenile. sex ratio, and
                   proportion of ovigerous females were strongly
                   affected by site or the interaction between month and
                   site ({\textgreater} 60{\%} of the random variation
                   in each case). The high variation observed between
                   mudflats for most demographic variables demonstrates
                   that several control sites are necessary for
                   measuring natural variation, a critical consideration
                   in studies of environmental impacts.},

  abstract =      {We analyzed data from two surveys of fall migrating
                   shorebirds in central and eastern North America to
                   estimate annual trends in means per survey and to
                   determine whether trends indicate a change in
                   population size or might have been caused by other
                   factors. The analysis showed a broad decline in means
                   per survey in Atlantic Canada and the northeastern
                   United States (North Atlantic region). For example, 9
                   of 9 significant trends in this region were
                   {\textless} 1 (P=0.004), and the mean, annual rate of
                   change among 30 species was 0.9783, a decline of
                   -2.17{\%} per year (P {\textless} 0.001). Trends in
                   the midwestern United States (Midwest region) showed
                   no clear pattern. The mean among 29 species was
                   1.0090 (P=0.35). Only 4 of the trends were
                   significant. Several hypotheses were evaluated to
                   identify causes of the declining means per survey in
                   the North Atlantic region. The most likely hypothesis
                   appears to be a decline in the breeding populations
                   that supply migrants to the North Atlantic region,
                   but a change in movements, for example passing
                   through the region more quickly in recent years,
                   cannot be excluded as an explanation. Further surveys
                   of arctic breeding areas coupled with analysis of
                   long-term survey data from western North America
                   would be helpful in determining whether the declines
                   found in this analysis are also occurring in other
                   areas.},

                   at some migratory stopover sites have shown
                   pronounced declines over the last 35 years. Counts
                   from breeding grounds avoid sources of bias that have
                   proven troublesome for trends estimated from
                   migration surveys. Published and unpublished data
                   were reviewed to examine trends in densities of
                   Semipalmated Sandpipers at breeding sites across
                   Alaska and arctic Canada. Information was sparse, and
                   some comparisons are tenuous because methods varied
                   over time. Valid time series were obtained for 13
                   sites across the species' range. In Alaska,
                   Semipalmated Sandpipers either increased or were at
                   least stable at six sites and decreased at one site.
                   Surveys at both sites in the central portion of the
                   range suggested no change in abundance. In the
                   eastern portion of the range, trends were variable:
                   decreases were observed at two sites, a possible
                   increase at one site, and no change at another. Thus,
                   the species was generally increasing or stable in the
                   western and central portions of the range and had an
                   uncertain status in the east. Also, trends in
                   presence/absence data were analyzed from the
                   Northwest Territories and Nunavut Checklist Survey.
                   The species was observed at 345 sites, and results
                   suggested that birds increased significantly in
                   prevalence (assumed here to be correlated with
                   abundance) across arctic Canada between 1987 and
                   2007. Overall, data from the breeding grounds do not
                   support a range-wide decline in the abundance of
                   Semipalmated Sandpipers, although data are
                   insufficient for the long-billed population from the
                   eastern Arctic for which specific conservation
                   concerns exist. Received 1 1 July 2011, accepted 2

  abstract = {Peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) have undergone a steady hemisphere-wide recovery since the ban on DDT in 1972, resulting in an ongoing increase in the level of danger posed for migrant birds, such as Arctic-breeding sandpipers. We anticipate that in response migrant semipalmated sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) have adjusted migratory behaviour, including a shift in stopover site usage towards locations offering greater safety from falcon predation.We assessed semipalmated sandpiper stopover usage within the Atlantic Canada Shorebird Survey dataset. Based on 3,030 surveys (totalling \~{}32M birds) made during southward migration, 1974 - 2017, at 198 stopover locations, we assessed the spatial distribution of site usage in each year (with a {\textquoteleft}priority matching distribution{\textquoteright} index, PMD) index in relation to the size (intertidal area) and danger (proportion of the intertidal area within 150m of the shoreline) of each location. The PMD index value is \&gt; 1 when usage is concentrated at dangerous locations, 1.0 when usage matches location size, and \&lt; 1 when usage is concentrated at safer locations.A large majority of migrants are found at the safest sties in all years, however our analysis of the PMD demonstrated that the fraction increased over time. In 1974, 80\% of birds were found at the safest 20\% of the sites, while in 2017, this had increased to 97\%. A sensitivity analysis shows that the shift was made specifically towards safer (and not just larger) sites. The shift as measured by a PMD index decline cannot be accounted for by possible biases inherent in the data set. We conclude that the data support the prediction that increasing predator danger has induced a shift by southbound migrant semipalmated sandpipers to safer sites.},
